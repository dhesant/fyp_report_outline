## Usage
### Linux
For Linux, install the packages "texlive" and "texlive-publisers" (e.g. "sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-publisers")
For compiling the document, you only need to run "make" in terminal

### Windows
For Windows, install the MiKTeX distribution (I have not tested this personally)
https://miktex.org/

### Overleaf
You can also use the online editor to edit the documents, just upload/copy them to a blank project.
